For this, it is sufficient to argue that on every level there is at most 1 node visited that has a key $\\leq 100$.\n",

The node with key $y$ is in the left subtree of $v$ and the node with key $y'$ in the right subtree; otherwise the lowest common ancestor would have been in one of the subtrees. But because $v$ has a node with key $\\leq 100$ in its right subtree, its key has to be $\\leq 100$. However, in this case we do not visit the left subtree of $v$, thus the node with key $y$ would have not been visited. \n",
