    "Given a doubly-linked list that stores one character with every node, design a linear-time algorithm that checks whether the characters form a palindrome. A *palindrome* is a sequence of characters, which reads the same backward as forward (e.g., 'l','e','v','e','l'). Your algorithm should be in-place (only a constant amount of extra memory). You may assume that you know the length of the list."
