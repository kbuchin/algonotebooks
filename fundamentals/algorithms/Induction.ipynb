    "Before using this to analyze the recurrence of MergeSort, let us take a closer look at the induction basis. In our example, we can read of which bases we should use from the recurrence: we had a special case for $n=1$, so this will be our base case. However, note that often recurrences are stated without base/special case. So then, we might simply get the recurrence stated as $T(n) = 2 T(n/2) + \\Theta(n)$. **Nonetheless, we need to handle the base case.** We can read it off from the algorithm as such ($n=1$ is a special case in the algorithm).

    "But if we really only have the recurrence, we will simply need to assume a suitable base case. How can we see that we don't need additional base cases? For $n=2$ we base $T(n)$ on $T(n/2) = T(1)$. So with the basis $n=1$ this is handled. Also for $n>2$ we base $T(n)$ on $T(n/2)$ with $1 \\leq n/2 < n$, so we always end up with a case that we have previously handled. In contrast, if we would analyze the recurrence $T(n) = T(n/6) + \\Theta (n)$, the base case $n=1$ is not enough: For $n=2$ we have $n/6 = 0$, so this is not handled by the case case $n=1$. We should have as basis $n=1$, $n=2$, $\\ldots$, $n=5$.   "

It may (or may not) seem a reasonable approach to simply check a handful of \"base cases\", and then conclude that the pattern will continue without providing an induction step. A peculiar example for which this approach would go wrong is based on the *Borwein integral*. See https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2018/09/20/patterns-that-eventually-fail/. There you find a sequence of integrals (depending on $n$), which evaluates to $\\pi/2$ for all $n < 9.8 \\cdot 10^{42}$, but eventually evaluates to different values. So only checking a few small cases would lead to a wrong conclusion."
