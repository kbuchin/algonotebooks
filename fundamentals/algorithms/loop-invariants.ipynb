This is exactly what *Termination* is about: Conclude from the loop invariant after the last iteration that the algorithm does what it should do. There is a slight subtlely: While the name *Termination* seems to imply that we need to prove that the algorithm terminates, *Termination* in most cases is more about showing that the loop invariant after completing the loop gives us a statement from which we then can conclude correctness. To make things more confusing: for the **for**-loops that we are considering, it is always obvious that they terminate, but it can happen that you have for instance a **while**-loop for which this is not so obvious. If the loop indeed doesn't terminate, then the proof won't work. So somewhere you will need to prove that the loop terminates. However, often this already happens in the analysis of the running time.

If this is confusing, one easy way to understand what $A[0:0]$ means, is to look at what happens when we go from $A[0:j+1]$ to $A[1:j]$: we drop $A[j]$. In our setting this means $A[0:0]$ is $A[0:1]=A[0]$ but with $A[0]$ removed. This means that nothing is left, and therefore $A[0:0]$ is is indeed simply an empty array.
