    "\n",

In this case it is not difficult to guess that the recurrence solves to $T(n) = O(n)$, which one could prove formally by induction. Often you will see the base case omitted in recurrences for running times. So the recurrence above would simply be written as \n",
    " \n",
    " $$T(n) = T(n-1) + O(1)$$\n",
    " \n",
    " The reason for this is that as soon as we have a problem of 'constant size', we can assume that the algorithm takes constant time on it. Specifically, in this case, the time to compute 1!, no matter what the algorithm does, will not depend on a general $n$, because there is no $n$ in $1!$.\n",

    " \n",
    " Now for binary search, the problem size actually reduces from $n$ to $n/2$. Again we spend constant time, so the recurrence is (we can ignore rounding issues here):\n",

    " This solves to $T(n) = O(\\log(n))$: The recursion depth corresponds to how often we can divide $n$ by $2$ until we hit 1, which is $\\log (n)$ (We use $\\log$ to denote the logarithm base 2). We only have 1 recursive call, so we are executing the code $\\log (n)$ times, always doing O(1) elementary operations. Therefore $T(n) = O(\\log (n)$.\n",
